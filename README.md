WeatherApp is a Java-based web application that provides real-time weather information for any city. 
The application allows users to enter the name of a city and fetches the current weather data, including temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and other relevant details. 
The backend of the application is built using Java Servlets and JSP, which handle user requests, make API calls to a weather service, and dynamically render the weather information on the frontend.
